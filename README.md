Finished up my first BG3 head for a fresh take on Wyll's head.
Threw in two styles â€“ one inspired by Shining South and another rocking the standard Baldurian vibe. Planning on whipping up more later.
Shining South hair won't be clip through horns now too (thanks Padme4000 for hair tutorial)
New camp outfit!

Preview and portraits use CharmaineCC's Wyll's True Bloodstone Eye; must get separate if wanting it.

- Added Calimshan variant
- Added Chult variant
- Added Neverwinter variant

Will move onto Karaturan next!
