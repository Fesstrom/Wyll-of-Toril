## What's New?

### Ravengard

I've given Calimsham, Karatur, Laothan, Neverwinter & Shining South a matching Ravengard.

### Contractor Devil Form

 - Wyll now looks more like a tiefling: 
   Tail, teeth, claws, Tiefling ears, body and markings.
 - If you are using the standard curly hair, I have blendered it so it won't clip through his horns and tiefling ears.

### Cosmetics addons
Options available for:
- Hair color
- Hair style 
- Eye color
- Remove removal
